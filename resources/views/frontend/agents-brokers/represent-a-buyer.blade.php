            <p>Register your buyer no less than 48 hours prior to the start of the auction-event. A cooperation fee is paid at closing if the buyer closes in accordance with the terms and conditions.

            <h2 class="text-blue-400 text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold my-4">Prior to Event Purchases</h2>
            <p>Submit an offer to purchase as you normally would with our Event Addendum. Make certain you attache the Event Addendum available as an addendum as this will save the seller from a counter. It may take a few days for the seller to respond. If the price is not acceptable, the seller will counter with a price that he or she are willing to pay to remove the property for the Event. HINT: Make your offer as appealing as possible to the seller, such as earnest money of 5 percent and as few contigencies as the buyer comfortable with. In some cases, your buyer may only get one chance at the property because we often have multiple offers on one property.</p>
            <p>Once an offer is accepted, the property is marked "pending" on our site, and we proceed with a normal closing through the seller's or buyer's local title company. Following completion, you are on your way to another sale!</p>
