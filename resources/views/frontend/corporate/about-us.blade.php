            <p>Founder and CEO Wade T. Micoley has been in the real estate industry for more than 30 years and has an extensive background in banking. His experience gave him a deep understanding of the flaws in real estate marketing and he decided to transform the industry with a Time-Limited Event marketing process. With the assistance of an incredible, devoted, and fun team (we call them "Customer Service Heroes"), we have reinvented the process of selling and buying Real Estate. Compared to traditional strategies, the RealtyHive marketing process is revolutionary.</p>
