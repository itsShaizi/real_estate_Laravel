	        <p>Founder and CEO Wade T. Micoley has been in the real estate industry for more than 30 years and has an extensive background in banking. His experience gave him a deep understanding of the flaws in real estate marketing and he decided to transform the industry with a Time-Limited Event marketing process. With the assistance of an incredible, devoted, and fun team (we call them "Customer Service Heroes"), we have reinvented the process of selling and buying Real Estate. Compared to traditional strategies, the RealtyHive marketing process is revolutionary.</p>       
	        <h2 class="text-blue-400 text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">How it all got started</h2>
	        <p>The event marketing process has been consistently optimized over many years of trial and success. It utilizes the best in print, media, and internet across local and international markets. With the help of industry leaders in sales, closing, and marketing, RealtyHive has launched a unique marketing solution for the variety of clients it serves. </p> 
	        <p>Today RealtyHive has sold thousands of properties and continues to serve the Real Estate community in the banking, agency/brokerage, and private sectors.
