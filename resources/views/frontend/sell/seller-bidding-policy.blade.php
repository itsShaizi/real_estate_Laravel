		            <p>
		                Shill bidding is defined as a seller making a bid on the property in order to increase its selling price, search standing, and attractiveness to actual bidders. This type of bidding also extends to anyone making a bid who is associated with the seller, such as an agent, friend, family member, or co-worker.
		            </p>
		            <br>
		            <p>
		                Some auction sites have strict policies concerning shill bidding as well. Well-respected sites remove listings where sellers bid on their own items and will often suspend or limit their accounts as a result. Some may even report the person to law enforcement. We at RealtyHive support these practices as they're key in discouraging sellers from bidding on their own properties.

		            It’s an unfortunate fact that most auction sites allow sellers or their agents to bid on their properties in order to make you, the real buyers, pay more. RealtyHive has a very strict no-seller-bidding policy. That’s why during every event, we confirm that no seller bidding has occurred on any of our properties.
